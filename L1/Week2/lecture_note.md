# **Installing R**

Now that we’ve got a handle on what a data scientist is, how to find answers, and then spent some time going over a data science example, it’s time to get you set up to start exploring on your own. And the first step of that is installing R.

## **What is R? What is CRAN?**

First, let’s remind ourselves exactly what R is and why we might want to use it.

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is both a programming language and an environment, focused mainly on statistical analysis and graphics. It will be one of the main tools you use in this and following courses.

R is downloaded from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/), or CRAN, and while this might be your first brush with it, we will be returning to CRAN time and time again, when we install packages - so keep an eye out!

## **Why should you use R?**

Outside of this course, you may be asking yourself - [why should I use R?](https://www.r-bloggers.com/why-use-r-five-reasons/)

The reasons for using R are myriad, but some big ones are:

**1) Its popularity**

- R is quickly becoming the standard language for statistical analysis. This makes R a great language to learn as the more popular a software is, the quicker new functionality is developed, the more powerful it becomes, and the better the support there is! Additionally, as you can see in the [graph below](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/), knowing R is one of the top five languages asked for in data scientist job postings!

**2) Its cost**

- FREE!
- This one is pretty self-explanatory - every aspect of R is free to use, unlike some other stats packages you may have heard of (eg: SAS, SPSS), so there is no cost barrier to using R!

**3) Its extensive functionality**

- R is a very versatile language - we’ve talked about its use in stats and in graphing, but its use can be expanded to many different functions - from making [websites](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html), making maps using [GIS data](http://www.nickeubank.com/gis-in-r/), analyzing [language](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/NaturalLanguageProcessing.html)… and even making these [lectures and videos](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ari/index.html)! For whatever task you have in mind, there is often a package available for download that does exactly that!

**4) Its community**

- And the reason that the functionality of R is so extensive is the community that has been built around R. Individuals have come together to make “packages” that add to the functionality of R - and more are being developed every day!

Particularly for people just getting started out with R, its community is a huge benefit - due to its popularity, there are multiple forums that have pages and pages dedicated to solving R problems. We talked about this in the Getting Help lesson; these forums are great both for finding other people who have had the same problem as you, and posting your own new problems.

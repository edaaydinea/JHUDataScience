# Version Control

**Version Control: An Overview**

- **Definition**: Version control is a system that records changes made to files over time. It takes snapshots of files as edits are made and saves them for future reference.
- **Track Changes Feature**: Similar to the track changes feature in Microsoft Word, which tracks and allows reverting to previous edits.
- **Git**: A sophisticated version control system developed in 2005. It tracks changes on multiple files, supports collaboration, and is widely used.
- **Benefits of Version Control**:
    - **Single Updated Version**: Maintains one updated version of each file with a record of all previous versions.
    - **Change Records**: Keeps a record of who, when, and why changes were made.
    - **Conflict Management**: Ensures that simultaneous edits do not conflict, facilitating merging of multiple changes.
- **Git**:
    - **Local Copy**: Keeps a local copy of work and revisions, which can be synced with the main online repository.
    - **Collaboration**: Allows multiple people to work on the same files simultaneously without disturbing the common repository.
- **GitHub**: An online interface for Git, similar to Dropbox. It hosts files and records changes online, integrating with Git to track file versions and changes.
- **Key Terms**:
    - **Repository (Repo)**: Equivalent to a projects folder. Contains all version-controlled files and changes.
    - **Commit**: Saving edits and changes. Each commit is like a snapshot with a message explaining the changes.
    - **Push**: Updating the online repository with local edits.
    - **Pull**: Updating the local version of the repository to reflect changes made by others.
    - **Staging**: Preparing a file for commit. Allows separating file changes into different commits.
    - **Branch**: Simultaneous copies of a file. Allows working on separate versions before merging.
    - **Merge**: Combining independent edits into a single file.
    - **Conflict**: Occurs when edits are incompatible. Requires manual resolution.
    - **Clone**: Copying an existing Git repository to create a local version.
    - **Fork**: Personal copy of a repository taken from another person.
- **Best Practices**:
    - **Purposeful Commits**: Each commit should address a single issue.
    - **Descriptive Messages**: Write precise commit messages to explain changes.
    - **Regular Updates**: Frequently pull and push changes to stay current with the repository.

**Summary**: Understanding version control, Git, and GitHub is essential for managing file changes, collaborating effectively, and maintaining organized project repositories.
